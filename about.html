		<h5>Yeabsira Agegnehu (2000)</h5>
		
		My name is Yeabsira Agegnehu. Raised in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, I was developed my drawing skills through local art programs. I became a member of the teen art computation then I found drawing is my skill, before up-and-coming in AAU I was top10 student.<br /><br />
		<h5>Early Years and Career Beginnings</h5>
		
		I was born on May 20, 2000, in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia. From my father Agegnehu and from my mother Genet, I grew up with both my father, mother and 2 younger brothers named Abemelek and Leul.
		</p>
		<p>I drew my first drawing at age 7 as my father told me and saw it on TV show named Mbc3. though my soon abandoned my potential in that area in favor playing soccer. I applied for an art school, and after a four-year waiting period, because of I was restless teenager found an outlet for my creative energy via improvisation classes.</p>

	<div class="desc2" style="font-size: 16px;color: gray;">
		<p>I continued my development as a student through a youth program at public school named “Yemane Birhan”. When I was 10 years old I hear the word architecture for the first from my English teacher who sow my drawing then took another step toward a career in show business (teen art exhibition) at age 16.
		</p><br>
		<p>I gained a life philosophy from my father he said that “everyone in this world is unique and special and don’t compare yourself with others since everyone has their own special qualities.” Which means there is only one you ,and what you do only you can do and no one can do it as u do it.  And by this I hope u would have known something about me.</p>
